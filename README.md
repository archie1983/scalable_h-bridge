So this is a simple, scalable H-bridge, that I made on my own inspired by a design of an H-bridge in some chinese toy car.

Nothing special really- just a dual motor h-bridge. Circuits like this can be bought off the shelf on Ebay, Amazon and many other places, but mine can be customised. 
So for instance I needed 4.5A of current to drive my little DC130 motors at 7.5V, but I could only find 2A designs on Ebay for a reasonable price, so I made my own. And if I ever want 6A for instance, all I need to do, is add 8 more transistors to the output stage: 4x SS8050 and 4x SS8550.

Other design ideas for future include adding reverse diodes to the output transistors to be able to drive bigger motors.
Also it will be nice to incorporate a microcontroller on the same board at some point in the future.

The project was designed in KiCad 5.0.1.

Please feel free to use and improve it.
